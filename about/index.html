                　my birthday is 16 Sep. I (unfortunately) live in the United States.<br>
                　things I find fun include coding, listening to music, playing video games, and watching YouTube & Twitch. I pride myself on being pretty carefree, minimal, and perfectionist. I don't have many friends – I'm not the social type at all – but I love the ones I do have with all my heart.<br>
                <br>
                　I'm fluent in Lua...and only Lua. I've really only ever used Roblox Studio, PICO-8, and LÖVE. I know some Python from my days with Ren'Py but I don't consider myself fluent.<br>
                　I'm technically bilingual – if you count a micro-conlang with &lt10,000 fluent speakers. I enjoy translating things, especially songs, even if basically no one will understand or care when I “eventually” upload them.<br>
                <br>　here's some specific likes/dislikes (incomplete and in no particular order):
